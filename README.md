# elisp.js

This aims to be a translator from Emacs Lisp to Javascript. 

## Why?

- One of the goals is to see how fast can be Emacs Lisp on v8;
- This might be the base for running Emacs packages in the browser (possibly using [Ymacs](http://www.ymacs.org/) as the UI of Emacs runtime) in the future;
- Learning Emacs Lisp and joy of writing yet another Lisp interpreter, of course!

## Run

```
$ npm install
$ npm run repl
```
